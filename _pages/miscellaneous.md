I use this webpage to keep track of some non-academic experiences/achievements.

## Networking

I'm also a proud member of:
- [**The VEF 2.0 Program**](https://vef2.org/page/directory.aspx#:~:text=Cohort%202023-,Cohort%202024,-COPYRIGHT%20%C2%A9%202024%20VEF) 
The VEF 2.0 Program is developed on the success of the Vietnam Education Foundation (VEF) Fellowship Program â€“ a program created by the U.S. Congress from 2003-2016 to strengthen the bilateral relationship between the United States and Vietnam through educational exchange activities. More information about the VEF 2.0 Program can be found [here](https://vef2.org/page/about-us.aspx).
- **Talent Nurturing Program**
Talent Nurturing Program is established based on the idea of Dr. Tran Thanh Hai and the contribution of prominent figures such as entrepreneurs and experts across Vietnam. With the motto "Talent goes hand in hand with humanity", the community not only raises funds to award scholarships to outstanding students of high schools but also organizes monthly exchange sessions in Hanoi between students, students and members, guests, sponsors of the program. In addition, the community also organizes useful extracurricular activities such as English Club, Career Orientation Club... to help students develop comprehensively in the future. All aim to build a solid, extensive network with all talents in all fields, so that you can support each other in the future and together build a rich and beautiful country.

## Hobbies

Besides academic work, I'm also into numerous hobbies:

#### Games and eSports

I am an avid fan of FPS games, such as Counter-Strike 2, Call of Duty, and Half-Life Series. Additionally, I also enjoy playing open-world games, such as GTA Online, Minecraft, and Disney Dreamlight Valley. I also follow eSports tournaments, especially the CS:GO Major Championships, ESL Pro Tour CS and BLAST Premier Series.

#### Music

I can't live without music. My primary genres is Electronic Dance Music (EDM) with concentration on high-energy subgenres such as Hardstyle, Big Room (with its Techno variant), and Psytrance. My favorite artists including, but not limited to:
- [Hardwell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMq7E3iPzbc)
- [Martin Garrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mT5E7Ol2A)
- [Sub Zero Project](https://youtu.be/7m0n8h8b89M?list=RDEMVH-ERLqovGfAq_V_iM1nrA&t=106)
- [Da Tweekaz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTTvpCBExGY)
- [Ran-D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5VLA4tEnV8)

However, EDM alone is not enough to balance my music taste. I also enjoy listening to Disney songs, primarily from the Disney Princesses (including Anna & Elsa), and Disney Parks' background music. This combination has created a unique playlist that I listen to daily:
